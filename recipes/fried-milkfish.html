        This recipe offers a straightforward method for preparing flavorful fried milkfish (bangus) with a simple marinade. 
        The milkfish is soaked in a mixture of soy sauce, vinegar, black pepper, and minced garlic, allowing it to absorb 
        these savory and slightly tangy notes. After marinating, the fish is fried in hot oil until both sides are cooked 
        through and likely crispy, resulting in a delicious and easy-to-prepare Filipino dish. The brief ingredient list 
        and uncomplicated cooking steps make this a convenient way to enjoy the distinct taste of milkfish.
