    <p>This recipe offers a delightful twist on classic fried chicken by incorporating calamansi, a small citrus fruit 
        popular in Filipino cuisine. Chicken pieces are marinated in a simple yet impactful blend of soy sauce, black pepper,  
        garlic and calamansi juice. The citrus not only tenderizes the chicken beautifully but also infuses it with a 
        signature Filipino flavor that is both refreshing and zesty. Coated simply in flour and fried to a perfect golden 
        crisp, the resulting chicken is juicy on the inside with a subtly tart and aromatic crust.
